Global Data Ownership Chain 
I．Brief Introduction to GDOC 
GDOC(Global Data Ownership Chain) is decentralized blockchain based on Delegated Proof of Stake ( DPOS) and Consensus mechanism with its unique DCMM（Dual Contribution-Mining Model）technology, which makes GDOC not only to motivate “producers”, but motivate “consumers”, and therefore results in more scalable and practical applications in the blockchain. Dual Contribution means that owners of data asset（including personal data/pictures /cartoons /P2P copyrights etc）obtain mining income and data asset extended income (for instance, via lease) through their contributing data assets；and consumers of data asset（Dapp developers）also obtain mining income through renting or using data asset. The core task of DCMM is to overcome the three predicaments in data asset trade. 

	Firstly, it gets rid of problems with unclear or embezzled rights of the ownership and income via data asset validation and on-chain technology. DCMM has implemented “contributing data is equivalent to mining”，resulting in validation of data ownership, protection of privacy and income model, all having been synchronously achieved which is not available in traditional Internet. 

	Secondly，it considerably reduces the threshold of Bigdata application and development on Internet-based. Traditional Bigdata application (including social media/P2p Financial Internet platform/sharing services etc) is in the period of “Red Sea” competition, and barbaric investment and “wasteful innovation”, increase the innovation threshed of Data application, and also reduce resource usage efficiency. GDOC not only offers data asset resources for Bigdata application developers, but also offers test environment and technology support for the application, and substantially shorten the verification cycle of Dapp business model，thereby considerably reduce investment in Dapp software and hardware as well. In a word, Dapp developers are able to implement Dapp application and development with “one person plus one computer” so as to facilitate blockchain-based application to touch down on a large scale.

	Thirdly, DCMM enables Dapp developers to receive income by hiring or consuming data assets through “contributing is mining" model, sustainably motivating its application and development. 

DCMM transaction model and DPOS consensus mechanism work on cointegration, which makes a variety of InternetApp to achieve higher effectiveness, lower cost and decentralization, with help of blockchain underlying protocol and open source book technology. For instance, Mr Weixin Chen is cooperating with Mr Jun Yang, Co-founder of Meituan Union, by investing and developing “Taxi Blockchain” project, aiming to decentralize to achieve low cost and high efficiency in Internet-based taxi operation.   

The following is the circulation model of GDOT Token.
STEP1: Token Mint: 
1.	GDOC Token POOL->[GDOT mint by Mining]->DO+DS/DAD
STEP2: Token circle as a payment:
2.	DO->[GDOT paid for DAD’s service]->DAD
STEP3: Token circle/Deflation Model
3.	DS/DAD->[GDOT frozen as collateral]->GDOT Token POOL
4.	DAD->[GDOT frozen as an ICO money]->GDOT Token POOL

In the GDOT circulation mechanism, DAD as a developer of the application rents data assets, under approval by GDOC, to gain usage of data asset by taking GDOT as collateral.
Furthermore, DAD issues ICO to raise fund as it is developing Dapp, and over 30% of its total fundraising is used as GDOT token.

II. Goal and Significance of GDOC
GDOC is to create ecosystem that economically benefits all participants by introducing blockchain-based Distributed Ledger Technology, DCMM and tokenized data assets in order to make “raw” data asset to appreciate in value in tens of millions of times, and ultimately to achieve data asset producers and consumers to autonomously cycle in scalable growth. Not only that, GDOC will facilitate Internet application to be diversified, low cost and high efficient, fair and trusted in the following grounds.

	Firstly, most of Internet App underlying on GDOC’s big-data asset exchange and transaction platform, reduce the development & operation costs so as to make global Internet-based application to be more diversified with higher efficiency.

	Secondly, GDOC is a decentralized autonomous organization, and it enables its own ecosystem to gain exponential growth relying upon Token and DCMM incentive mechanism with little cost and operational expenditure.

	Thirdly and finally, InternetApp may use Token to complete payment, and this will dramatically reduce the price of consumers using App, thereby will be beneficial to all participants in GDOC.

Consequently, the core value of GDOC is not only to create a data asset trade & exchange system based on blockchain’s DPOS consensus mechanism and DCMM contribution transaction model, but more importantly, is to configure an innovative application pattern and business model surpassing the current Internet-based business model. 

In the very near future, GDOC will incubate thousands of hundreds of Internet-based Dapps, and will enable Internet-based application to be much higher efficient/lower costly, completely surpassing the present monopolistic and centralized large scale Internet organizations, including social media such as Facebook, Tencent etc and e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba, Amazon and Jindong.
 
III. The Team
Mr Musk Shing and Dr Alexander Wang etc, as professional experts in IT and Bigdata, have established GDOC Foundation to lead and operate GDOC project in technological research and business development.
GDOC core team consists of elites from China, USA, Japan and Southeast Asia. The Founder, Mr Musk Shing has over 10 years of experiences in IT and Internet; a number of core engineers comes from famous universities and Global 500, such as IBM and Huawei. For instance, Dr YG SUN (Algorithm & Security Expert) during the same period of Satoshi Nakamot (the Founder of Bitcoin), studied and developed Ellipse encryption Algorithm and published his PhD Thesis on this topic（http://i.cnki.net/HD/thesis/detail/cdfd/2009091413.nh. Dr YG SUN is in charge of GDOC consensus mechanism and encryption algorithm both in theoretical and technological innovation. Dr Alexander WANG(Co-Founder and COO) graduated at University of Abertay Dundee, UK, majoring in Artificial Neural Network, and he has created an unique theory and technological innovation in data mining and neural network active learning algorithm(please refer to the paper: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s521-001-8053-6, Neural Computing & Applications, December 2001, Volume 10, Issue 3, pp 253–263）. Dr Alexander WANG is the founder of Shared Cloud-Umbrella Internet-based Project, being of expertise in sharing economy and AI industries.  Mr William Yang(Security Director ) has a rich experience in Internet Security and Technology (he used to be a hacker of White Hat)，responsible for GDOC network security, code verification and smart contract writing and deploying. 
At the same time，GDOC has a number of senior advisors in Bigdata and AI, including Dr Shi Zhong, data scientist of Google, and Dr Teruaki HAYASH, an expert in Bigdata security and management & Associate Professor of Tokyo University in Japan. They will provide GDOC with theoretical and technological supports.
In addition, GDOC has won support and recognition from experts and advisors in Blockchain. Dr JiangangWu，the Co-Founder of Fusion and PhD in Financial Engineering，has given unique insights and helps for GDOC technology and application. Mr Chandler Guo is a pioneer and expert in Blockchain, we have benefited from his ideas and his Bitcoin’s value theory deeply influencing blockchain.
Mr Ken Huang is a registered expert in CISSP, committee member of ACM Practitioner Board in USA and expert member of Blockchain of Chinese Institute of Electronics. He gives us some innovative ideas and advices for GDOC overall technological profile design.
